<b>Title</b>: Simple Moving Memory Game

<b>Front-End</b>: REACT


<b>Description</b>: 
> Circles to memorise will appear in green and then hide themselves from the user. <br>
> The user will then memorise these green circles as they and other circles bounce around the screen. <br>
> More balls will be created as the user completes the game. <br>



<b>Status</b>:
Game is Functional.

<b>Future Improvements</b>:
> Update Visual and Animations <br>
> Add Sound Effects<br>
> Update Difficulty<br>

<b> Notes <b>:
> React Strict Mode will cause level difficult to increse twice instead of once due to it running twice. This ONLY occurs in development mode so production is fine.<br>
